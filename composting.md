# A Beginner's Guide to Composting

Composting is the natural process of recycling organic matter, such as leaves and food scraps, into a valuable fertilizer that can enrich soil and plants.

## Why Compost?
- Enriches soil, helping retain moisture and suppress plant diseases.
- Reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.
- Reduces methane emissions from landfills and lowers your carbon footprint.

## What to Compost (The "Greens" and "Browns")
