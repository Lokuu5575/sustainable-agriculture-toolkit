# Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM)** is a sustainable approach to pest control that combines cultural, biological, mechanical, and chemical measures to minimize damage while protecting the environment, human health, and beneficial organisms.

## 1. Overview
IPM emphasizes monitoring, threshold-based decisions, and a combination of tactics rather than frequent blanket pesticide use. The aim is long-term prevention and suppression of pest populations.

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Prevention** — design and manage cropping systems to reduce pest establishment (crop rotation, resistant varieties, sanitation).  
2. **Monitoring** — regular scouting and record-keeping to detect pest presence and population trends.  
3. **Thresholds** — take action only when pest levels exceed economic or action thresholds.  
4. **Control hierarchy** — prefer non-chemical measures first (cultural, biological, mechanical), chemical control as a last resort.  
5. **Evaluation** — review outcomes and adapt the plan.

## 3. Common IPM Techniques
### Cultural Controls
- Crop rotation and intercropping.  
- Selecting resistant/tolerant varieties.  
- Adjusting planting dates to avoid peak pest periods.  
- Proper irrigation and fertility management to reduce plant stress.

### Biological Controls
- Encourage natural enemies (predators, parasitoids).  
- Release biocontrol agents where appropriate (use local extension guidance).  
- Maintain habitat (flowering strips) for beneficial insects.

### Mechanical & Physical Controls
- Traps (pheromone, sticky), barriers, handpicking.  
- Soil solarization or mulches in small plots.

### Chemical Control (last resort)
- Use selective, least-toxic products and follow label instructions.  
- Apply at the right time and dose to minimize non-target impacts.  
- Rotate modes of action to reduce resistance.

## 4. Implementation Checklist (practical steps)
1. Map the field and record crop history.  
2. Establish a scouting calendar (how often to inspect, what to record).  
3. Set local action thresholds (consult extension/guidelines).  
4. Start with cultural and biological controls.  
5. If thresholds are exceeded, choose the least-persistent chemical option and apply targeted treatments.  
6. Record every action and review outcomes.

## 5. Small-scale example (tomato grower)
- Rotate tomatoes out of plots for 2–3 seasons.  
- Install sticky traps and scout weekly.  
- Introduce companion plants to attract predators.  
- If whitefly populations exceed threshold, use targeted insecticidal soap or neem as a spot treatment.

## 6. Monitoring template (example fields to record)
- Date, plot, crop, pest observed, pest count, natural enemies present, action taken, product used, outcome.

## 7. Resources & further reading
- Local agricultural extension services for regional thresholds and permitted products.  
- FAO/University extension IPM guides (search online for region-specific guidance).
